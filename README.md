## Game Description
The main action in this game is movement. Without movement the game becomes almost redundant.\
The hardest part to get working in Unreal was the C++ Blueprint node. Making the node without using C++ was quite easy, but using C++ was much more challenging, but this was mainly due to my lack of knowledge in C++. Despite the diffculty, the end result was almost as succinct as the alternative option.\
The most interesting part of the game to me was weapon and weapon physics. Initially I was unaware as to how it was possible to "program" a projectile firing out of a weapon within a game. But after using Unreal and learning how Unreal handles the physics, it was amazing to see how much of the nitty-gritty physical details that Unreal will take care of behind the scenes. Another intersting part of the game was the lighting. Although its incredibly simple, I was very interested in the development process as to how much of the real-world that the Unreal Engine draws from in order to produce lighting effects. From different materials, to how the shape of certain materials bends and reflects light, to how the placement of certain light affects shadows being cast from walls.
